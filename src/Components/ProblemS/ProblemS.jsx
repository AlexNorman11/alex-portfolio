            Throughout the development of my portfolio, I encountered several challenges that required innovative solutions. One significant challenge was achieving responsive design without relying on CSS frameworks. I tackled this by mastering CSS responsive values, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices. Additionally, routing pages and specific sections within them proved difficult, but I overcame this by leveraging React-Router and custom JavaScript code, resulting in smooth navigation throughout the site. Finally, animating SVGs was another complex task. By delving into SVG animation techniques and integrating them effectively, I added dynamic and engaging visual elements to my portfolio. These problem-solving experiences not only enhanced my technical skills but also enriched the overall functionality and user experience of my project.
